/*
Comments can be used to explain code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.

Comments can be singled-lined or multi-lined.
*/

//Single-line Comments---->

/*
Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//).

Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by the compiler (will not be executed).

This example uses a single-line comment before a line of code:
*/
//Code:--


#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  // This is a Single-line comment
  printf("Hello World!");
  return 0;
}
