//Practical Number      : 02
//Problem Specification : Entering comments

//Code : 

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf ("Single-line Commmnts\n"); //This is Single-line Commmnts

    printf ("Multi-line Commmnts");
    /*
     This is 
         Multi-Line
              Comments
    */
    return 0;
}


//Output     : 
                 /*
                Single-line Commmnts
                Multi-line Commmnts
                */


//Conclusion : 

/*
**Single-line Comments**
Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//).

Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by the compiler (will not be executed).
*/

// **Multi-line Comments**
//Multi-line comments start with /* and ends with */.

//Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by the compiler.
